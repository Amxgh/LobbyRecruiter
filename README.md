# Lobby-Stat-Check
This script will go through your minecraft chat logs (by default configured for Lunar Client on a windows machine) and check their stats to see if they meet a set of requirements. You may need to change the requirements to your desired values.

To use this script properly you must be able to run python on your device. 

# How to use

- Make sure you have filled in the 'user' and 'API_KEY' variables and ensure the 'path' is correct.
- Type '/list' while in a hypixel lobby
- Run the script, all players who meet requirements and are not already in a hypixel guild will have their ign's printed to the terminal. The script should only take a few seconds to run.
